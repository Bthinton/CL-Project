A website for a friend's flooring company. I created this website using a mobile first approach,
the website is responsive to all screen sizes via use of media queries. Using JQuery I added a
photo carousel as the banner element, which allows you to scroll through images with either the
"prev" or "next" buttons, as well as the dots beneath the pictures. Another feature would be the
embedded google map element for a little extra user activity. Finally in the footer is a small 
facebook icon that will link to my facebook page. In this project I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

To view my project simply download all the files within the folder and open the index.html file in
your browser or goto the link below.
